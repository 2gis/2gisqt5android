    \brief The Qt WebEngine Widgets module provides a web browser engine as well as
    C++ classes to render and interact with web content.

    Qt WebEngine Widgets provides a Web browser engine that makes it easy to embed
    content from the World Wide Web into your Qt application.

    Qt WebEngine Widgets provides facilities for rendering of HyperText Markup
    Language version 5 (HTML5), Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) and Scalable
    Vector Graphics (SVG) documents, styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
    and scripted with JavaScript.

    In addition to providing pure rendering features, HTML documents can be
    made fully editable to the user through the use of the \c{contenteditable}
    attribute on HTML elements.

    Qt WebEngine is based on the Chromium project. More information about
    Chromium itself can be found on the \l{http://www.chromium.org}
    {Chromium Project} Web site.

    \section1 Should I use Qt WebEngine or Qt WebKit?

    Qt WebEngine supercedes the \l{Qt WebKit Widgets}{Qt WebKit} module, which
    was based on the WebKit project, but isn't actively synchronized with the
    upstream WebKit code since Qt 5.2.

    Chromium provides its own network and painting engines and is developed
    tightly together with its dependent modules, thus Qt WebEngine provides
    better and more reliable support for the latest HTML5 specification.
    For this reason Qt WebEngine is however heavier than Qt WebKit and doesn't
    give direct access to the network stack and the HTML document through C++ APIs.

    For new code we suggest using Qt WebEngine, but it makes sense to continue
    using Qt WebKit for applications that are in need of a deeper C++ API than
    having better and up-to-date support for HTML, CSS and JavaScript features.

    For tips on how to change a Qt WebKit application to use Qt WebEngine, see
    \l{Porting from Qt WebKit to Qt WebEngine}

    \section1 Including In Your Project

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:

    \snippet snippets/qtwebengine_build_snippet.qdoc 1

    To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
    .pro file:

    \snippet snippets/qtwebengine_build_snippet.qdoc 0

    \section1 Architecture

    The easiest way to render content is through the QWebEngineView class. As a
    widget it can be embedded into your forms and it provides convenience functions
    for downloading and rendering web sites.

    \snippet snippets/simple/main.cpp Using QWebEngineView

    QWebEngineView is used to view Web pages. An instance of QWebEngineView has one
    QWebEnginePage. QWebEnginePage provides access to the page's navigation history,
    allows to run JavaScript code in the context of the page's main frame and enables
    customization of handlers for specific events such as showing custom authentication
    dialogs.

    Qt provides an integrated Web browser component based on Chromium, the popular
    open source browser engine.

    These examples and demonstrations show a range of different uses for Qt WebEngine,
    from displaying Web pages within a Qt user interface to an implementation of
    a basic function Web browser.
