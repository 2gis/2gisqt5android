    \since QtWebEngine 1.0
    \brief The QWebEngineSettings class provides an object to store the settings used
    by QWebEnginePage

    \inmodule QtWebEngineWidgets

    Each QWebEnginePage object has its own QWebEngineSettings object, which configures the
    settings for that page. If a setting is not configured, then it is looked
    up in the global settings object, which can be accessed using
    globalSettings().

    QWebEngineSettings allows configuration of browser properties, such as font sizes and
    families, the location of a custom style sheet, and generic attributes like
    JavaScript and plugins. Individual attributes are set using the setAttribute()
    function. The \l{QWebEngineSettings::WebAttribute}{WebAttribute} enum further describes
    each attribute.

/*!
    \enum QWebEngineSettings::FontFamily

    This enum describes the generic font families defined by CSS 2.
    For more information see the
    \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html#generic-font-families}{CSS standard}.

/*!
    \enum QWebEngineSettings::FontSize

    This enum describes the font sizes configurable through QWebEngineSettings.

    \value MinimumFontSize The hard minimum font size.
    \value MinimumLogicalFontSize The minimum logical font size that is applied
        when zooming out with QWebEngineFrame::setTextSizeMultiplier().
    \value DefaultFontSize The default font size for regular text.
    \value DefaultFixedFontSize The default font size for fixed-pitch text.
*/

/*!
    \enum QWebEngineSettings::WebAttribute

    This enum describes various attributes that are configurable through QWebEngineSettings.

    \value AutoLoadImages Specifies whether images are automatically loaded in
        web pages. This is enabled by default.
    \value JavascriptEnabled Enables or disables the running of JavaScript
        programs. This is enabled by default
    \value JavascriptCanOpenWindows Specifies whether JavaScript programs
        can open new windows. This is enabled by default.
    \value JavascriptCanAccessClipboard Specifies whether JavaScript programs
        can read or write to the clipboard. This is disabled by default.
    \value LinksIncludedInFocusChain Specifies whether hyperlinks should be
        included in the keyboard focus chain. This is enabled by default.
    \value LocalStorageEnabled Specifies whether support for the HTML 5
        local storage feature is enabled or not. This is enabled by default.
    \value LocalContentCanAccessRemoteUrls Specifies whether locally loaded documents are
        allowed to access remote urls. This is disabled by default. For more information
        about security origins and local vs. remote content see QWebEngineSecurityOrigin.
    \value XSSAuditingEnabled Specifies whether load requests should be monitored for cross-site
        scripting attempts. Suspicious scripts will be blocked and reported in the inspector's
        JavaScript console. Enabling this feature might have an impact on performance
        and it is disabled by default.
    \value SpatialNavigationEnabled Enables or disables the Spatial Navigation
        feature, which consists in the ability to navigate between focusable
        elements in a Web page, such as hyperlinks and form controls, by using
        Left, Right, Up and Down arrow keys. For example, if a user presses the
        Right key, heuristics determine whether there is an element they might be
        trying to reach towards the right and which element they probably want.
        This is disabled by default.
    \value LocalContentCanAccessFileUrls Specifies whether locally loaded documents are
        allowed to access other local urls. This is enabled by default. For more information
        about security origins and local vs. remote content see QWebEngineSecurityOrigin.
    \value HyperlinkAuditingEnabled This setting enables support for the ping attribute for hyperlinks. It is disabled by default.
    \value ScrollAnimatorEnabled This setting enables animated scrolling. It is disabled by default.
    \value ErrorPageEnabled This setting enables built-in error pages of Chromium. It is enabled by default.
