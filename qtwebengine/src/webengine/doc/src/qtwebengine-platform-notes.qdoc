    \title Qt WebEngine Platform Notes

    \brief Contains information about issues that are specific to the Qt WebEngine module.

    \section1 Target Platforms

    Qt WebEngine does try to support all \l{Supported Platforms} of Qt. However, due to
    different requirements of Chromium this is not always possible. Known limitations are:

    \list
        \li Qt WebEngine currently supports only Windows, Linux, and OS X.

        \li On Windows, Qt WebEngine only supports Windows Vista or newer as target platform.
            Due to use of newer API in Chromium, Windows XP is not supported. WinRT is
            not supported, either.
    \endlist

    \section1 Building Qt WebEngine from Source

    The requirements for building Qt 5 modules from source are listed separately for each supported
    platform:

    \list
        \li \l{Qt for Windows - Requirements}
        \li \l{Qt for X11 Requirements}
        \li \l{Qt for OS X - Requirements}
    \endlist

    In addition, the following tools are required for building the \l {Qt WebEngine} module:

    \list
        \li Windows: Visual Studio 2013 or Visual Studio 2015
        \li Linux: Clang or GCC version 4.7 or later
        \li OS X: Xcode version 5.1 or later on OS X 10.9 or later
    \endlist

    \section1 Pepper Plugin API Support

    Qt WebEngine supports loading Pepper Plugin API (PPAPI) plugins. The plugins must be loaded
    manually using the Chromium command line syntax with the \c --register-pepper-plugins argument.
    The argument value is a list of entries, separated by commas, that contain the file path and
    one or several MIME types, separated by semicolons:

    \code
    <file-path-plugin1>;<mime-type-plugin1>,<file-path-plugin2>;<mime-type1-plugin2>;<mime-type2-plugin2>
    \endcode

    For example:

    \code
    --register-pepper-plugins="libppapi_example.so;application/x-ppapi-example"
    \endcode

    The MIME type is important because it determines which embeds the plugin is used for.

    This process has been automated for the Pepper Flash player plugin.

    \section2 Pepper Flash Player Plugin Support

    The Pepper Flash player plugin can be loaded automatically if it is installed in one of the
    following locations, depending on the platform:

    \list
        \li Windows
            \code
            C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\pepflashplayer*.dll
            C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash\pepflashplayer*.dll
            \endcode
        \li OS X
            \code
            /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/PepperFlashPlayer/PepperFlashPlayer.plugin
            \endcode
        \li Linux
            \code
            /usr/lib/pepperflashplugin-nonfree/libpepflashplayer.so
            /usr/lib/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so
            /usr/lib64/chromium/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so
            \endcode
    \endlist

    You can also load the Pepper Flash player from a specific location by using command line
    arguments:

    \code
    --ppapi-flash-path=./libpepflashplayer.so
    \endcode

    \section1 Audio and Video Codec Support

    Qt WebEngine supports the MPEG-4 Part 14 (MP4) file format only if the required proprietary
    audio and video codecs, such as H.264 and MPEG layer-3 (MP3), have been enabled. Proprietary
    codecs can be enabled by passing the following option to qmake:

    \code
    qmake WEBENGINE_CONFIG += use_proprietary_codecs
    \endcode

    \warning When distributing proprietary codec libraries, you must acquire licenses for them.

    \l FFmpeg is a cross-platform solution to record, convert, and stream audio and video. It can
    be configured for use with several codecs, which rises licensing issues during distribution
    with the codec libraries. For some codecs, open source implementations, such as \l {OpenH264},
    are available.

    \section1 Default QSurfaceFormat OpenGL Profile Support

    If a new default QSurfaceFormat with a modified OpenGL profile has to be set, it should be set
    before the application instance is declared, to make sure that all created OpenGL contexts use
    the same OpenGL profile.

    On OS X, if the default QSurfaceFormat is set after the application instance, the application
    will exit with qFatal(), and print a message that the default QSurfaceFormat should be set
    before the application instance.
