Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed.
http://martine.github.com/ninja/

See the manual -- http://martine.github.com/ninja/manual.html or
doc/manual.asciidoc included in the distribution -- for background
and more details.

To build, run ./bootstrap.py.  It first blindly compiles all non-test
source files together, then re-builds Ninja using itself.  You should
end up with a 'ninja' binary in the source root.  Run './ninja -h' for
help.

There is no installation step.  The only file of interest to a user
is the resulting ninja binary.

If you're interested in making changes to Ninja, read HACKING.md first.
