Notes to myself on all the steps to make for a Ninja release.

Push new release branch:
1. Consider sending a heads-up to the ninja-build mailing list first
2. update src/version.cc with new version (with ".git"), then
       git commit -a -m 'mark this 1.5.0.git'
3. git checkout release; git merge master
4. fix version number in src/version.cc (it will likely conflict in the above)
5. fix version in doc/manual.asciidoc
6. commit, tag, push (don't forget to push --tags)
       git commit -a -m v1.5.0; git push origin release
       git tag v1.5.0; git push --tags
       # Push the 1.5.0.git change on master too:
       git checkout master; git push origin master
7. construct release notes from prior notes
   credits: git shortlog -s --no-merges REV..

Release on github:
1. https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software

Make announcement on mailing list:
1. copy old mail

Update website:
(note to self: website is now in github.com/martine/martine.github.io)
1. rebuild manual, put in place on website
2. update home page mention of latest version.
