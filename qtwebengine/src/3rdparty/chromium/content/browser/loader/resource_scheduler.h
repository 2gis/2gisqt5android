// There is one ResourceScheduler. All renderer-initiated HTTP requests are
// expected to pass through it.
//
// There are two types of input to the scheduler:
// 1. Requests to start, cancel, or finish fetching a resource.
// 2. Notifications for renderer events, such as new tabs, navigation and
//    painting.
//
// These input come from different threads, so they may not be in sync. The UI
// thread is considered the authority on renderer lifetime, which means some
// IPCs may be meaningless if they arrive after the UI thread signals a renderer
// has been deleted.
//
// The ResourceScheduler tracks many Clients, which should correlate with tabs.
// A client is uniquely identified by its child_id and route_id.
//
// Each Client may have many Requests in flight. Requests are uniquely
// identified within a Client by its ScheduledResourceRequest.
//
// Users should call ScheduleRequest() to notify this ResourceScheduler of a
// new request. The returned ResourceThrottle should be destroyed when the load
// finishes or is canceled.
//
// The scheduler may defer issuing the request via the ResourceThrottle
// interface or it may alter the request's priority by calling set_priority() on
// the URLRequest.
