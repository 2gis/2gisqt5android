Description:
General purpose compression library

Local Modifications:
A few minor changes, all marked with "Google":
- Added #ifdefs to avoid compile warnings when NO_GZCOMPRESS is defined.
- Removed use of strerror for WinCE in gzio.c.
- Added 'int z_errno' global for WinCE, to which 'errno' is defined in zutil.h.
- Added 'mozzconf.h' to mangle the function names.
- Added logic in zlib.h to undef our earlier mangles when defaulting to 64 bit offset versions of API.
The 'google.patch' file represents our changes from the original zlib-1.2.5.

A more significant change to support mixed-source data compression. See
crbug.com/139744 and mixed-source.patch.
