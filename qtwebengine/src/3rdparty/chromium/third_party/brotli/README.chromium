Description:
Brotli is a generic byte-level compression algorithm that is proposed to
be used at the byte-compression level in WOFF 2.0 font file format.

This library is used by src/third_party/ots, to decode WOFF 2.0 fonts.

The font-compression-reference repository includes WOFF 2.0 encoder and
tools, but Chrome/Chromium need only files under brotli/dec.
