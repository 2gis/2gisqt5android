## The fine print

Before we can use your code you have to sign the [Google Individual
Contributor License
Agreement](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html), which you can do online. This is mainly
because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your
contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to
use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other
things, for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code
infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to do this until
after you've submitted your code for review and a member has approved
it, but you will have to do it before we can put your code into our
codebase.

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement
than the one above, the [Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License
Agreement](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).
