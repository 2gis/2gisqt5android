Description:
  Libsrtp provides secure media transmission in a real
  time communication. It's used with libjingle which
  provides the p2p session setup.

  Libsrtp is distributed under the following BSD-based license, detailed info
  in srtp/LICENSE.

Local Modifications:

Replace 'inline' with 'INLINE' and #define to either 'inline' or '__inline'.
This is required because VS2012 does not allow redefinition of keywords via
macros, but also does not support 'inline' in C files.

Adding additional RTP header check

Added gyp support to __arm64__
