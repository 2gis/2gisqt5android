This directory provides a new class, GtkUndoView. It is based on GtkTextView
from the GTK+ project, but with undo/redo support added. The code to add this
support is borrowed from the GtkSourceView project. Since GtkSourceView has a
lot of other stuff we don't want, we borrow only the undo/redo support and add
it to GtkTextView to create GtkUndoView.
