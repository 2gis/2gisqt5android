<!--
  The <html-echo> injects given |content| into its innerHTML, bypassing HTML
  escaping, which is always made by Polymer when we insert the result of an
  Polymer expresion into element's body.

  Example:

  <html-echo content="<div>Hello</div>"></html-element>

  will be equivalent to:

  <span><div>Hello</div></span>
-->
<polymer-element name="html-echo" attributes="content"></polymer-element>
