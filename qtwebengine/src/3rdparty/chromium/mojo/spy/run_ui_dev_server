"""Starts the mojo spy dev server.

During normal usage of mojo spy, the spy files are compiled into standalone
HTML+JS+CSS snippets that are then embedded in the mojo shell.

The dev server allows edit-reload style development of the spy UI in isolation
of the c++ bits. To use, start the dev server, navigate to the URL the script
prints, and run any of the tests listed. Reloading in the browser loads the
latest content from disk, enabling a traditional web development workflow.
