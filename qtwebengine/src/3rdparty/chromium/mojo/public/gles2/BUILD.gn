# In an is_component_build build, everything can link against //mojo/gles2
# because it is built as a shared library. However, in a static build,
# //mojo/gles2 is linked into an executable (e.g., mojo_shell), and must be
# injected into other shared libraries (i.e., Mojo Apps) that need the mojo
# gles2 API.
#
# For component targets, add //mojo/public/gles2:for_component to your deps
# section.
#
# For shared_library targets (e.g., a Mojo App), add
# //mojo/public/gles2:for_shared_library to your deps
