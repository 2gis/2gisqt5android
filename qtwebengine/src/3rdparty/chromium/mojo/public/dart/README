These are interim instructions for building and testing Dart's Mojo bindings.
These instructions currently only work for Linux, and assume you already have a
Mojo checkout.

1.) Install the Dart SDK.

- apt-get -

Follow instructions at: https://www.dartlang.org/tools/debian.html

- Debian package -

Download from:

$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/dev/release/latest/linux_packages/debian_wheezy/dart_1.8.0-dev.2.0-1_amd64.deb
$ dpkg -i dart_1.8.0-dev.2.0-1_amd64.deb

- From source -

Follow instructions here: https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/Building

and build the "create_sdk" target.

With the first two options, dart is on your path and you are ready to go.
When building from source, you must explicitly add
e.g. out/ReleaseX64/dart-sdk/bin to your path.


2.) Configure Mojo with Dart.

  $ ./mojob.sh --release --with-dart gn


3.) Build Mojo with Dart.

  $ ./mojob.sh --release build


4.) Run Dart tests.

  $ ./mojob.sh --release darttest
