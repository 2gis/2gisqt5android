    \title Getting Started with Qt
    \brief A quick guide for developers

    Qt Framework and tools can be installed using an online installer,
    offline installers, or by building the source packages yourself.
    The \e{online installers} give you the option to download or install only
    certain modules or add-ons. An \e{offline installer} is a single package
    which contains all of Qt and Add-Ons relevant for a target platform.

    The open-source versions are found at the \l Downloads page
    and the commercial versions are available for a free trial from
    \l{Try Qt Enterprise}{Digia}.

    You can use the Qt installers to download and install the following
    components:

    \list
    \li Qt libraries, prebuilt for a particular development platform (operating
     system and compiler)
    \li Qt Creator integrated development environment (IDE)
    \li Reference Documentation and examples
    \li Qt in source code form (needed only if you want to build the framework and
      tools yourself)
    \li Add-On components that are relevant for different platforms
    \endlist

    After downloading, start the installer like any executable on the
    development platform. Select the components that you want to install and
    follow the instructions of the installation program to complete the
    installation.

    Use the Maintenance Tool under \e{<install_dir>} to add, update, or remove
    installed components.
