\title Integrating Web Content
\brief Qt's WebKit integration

Qt provides a \l {http://www.webkit.org/}{WebKit}-based layout engine
with support for a wide range of standard web techologies such as HTML, CSS and
JavaScript, that make it possible to embed content from the World Wide Web into
your Qt application. Qt features both WebKit-based QML and C++ APIs.


\section1 WebKit for QML Applications

\l{Qt WebKit} allows WebKit 2 functionality in QML applications by
importing the \l{WebView} QML type. \l WebView has a minimalistic QML API for
web content visualization. While it is not as feature-rich as the C++ API of the
widget classes, it has multi-touch support and employs a multi-process
architecture to render web content in a separate helper process (QtWebProcess).
WebView makes it possible to interact with content using touch gestures such as
panning with inertia (flick), pinch-zoom, tap and double- tap-to-zoom. The
underlying split-process model (\l
{http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKit2}{WebKit2}) assures smooth animations in the
embedding application (UI process) as well as increases stability.

\section1 Qt WebKit Widgets

The \l{Qt WebKit Widgets} module provides a feature-rich C++ API that
facilitates loading, viewing, and editing web documents. Qt WebKit Widgets
provides facilities for rendering of HyperText Markup Language (HTML),
Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
documents, styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripted with
JavaScript.
