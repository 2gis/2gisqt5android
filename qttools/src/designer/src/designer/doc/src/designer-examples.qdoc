    \title Qt Designer Examples
    \brief Using Qt Designer to build your UI.

    Qt Designer is a capable graphical user interface designer that lets you
    create and configure forms without writing code. GUIs created with
    Qt Designer can be compiled into an application or created at run-time.

    The following examples illustrate how to create and use Qt Designer forms
    and how to create Qt Designer custom widget plugins.
