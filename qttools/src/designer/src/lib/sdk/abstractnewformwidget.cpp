    \brief QDesignerNewFormWidgetInterface provides an interface for chooser
           widgets that can be used within "New Form" dialogs and wizards.
           It presents the user with a list of choices taken from built-in
           templates, pre-defined template paths and suitable custom widgets.
           It provides a static creation function that returns \QD's
           implementation.
