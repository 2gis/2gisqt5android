    Camera is part of the \b{QtMultimedia 5.0} module.

    You can use \c Camera to capture images and movies from a camera, and manipulate
    the capture and processing settings that get applied to the images.  To display the
    viewfinder you can use \l VideoOutput with the Camera set as the source.

    \qml

    import QtQuick 2.0
    import QtMultimedia 5.0

    Item {
        width: 640
        height: 360

            id: camera

            imageProcessing.whiteBalanceMode: CameraImageProcessing.WhiteBalanceFlash

            exposure {
                exposureCompensation: -1.0
                exposureMode: Camera.ExposurePortrait
            }

            flash.mode: Camera.FlashRedEyeReduction

            imageCapture {
                onImageCaptured: {
                    photoPreview.source = preview  // Show the preview in an Image
                }
            }
        }

        VideoOutput {
            source: camera
            anchors.fill: parent
            focus : visible // to receive focus and capture key events when visible
        }

        Image {
            id: photoPreview
        }
    }
    \endqml

    The various settings and functionality of the Camera stack is spread
    across a few different child properties of Camera.

    \table
    \header \li Property \li Description
    \row \li \l {CameraCapture} {imageCapture}
         \li Methods and properties for capturing still images.
    \row \li \l {CameraRecorder} {videoRecording}
         \li Methods and properties for capturing movies.
    \row \li \l {CameraExposure} {exposure}
         \li Methods and properties for adjusting exposure (aperture, shutter speed etc).
    \row \li \l {CameraFocus} {focus}
         \li Methods and properties for adjusting focus and providing feedback on autofocus progress.
    \row \li \l {CameraFlash} {flash}
         \li Methods and properties for controlling the camera flash.
    \row \li \l {CameraImageProcessing} {imageProcessing}
         \li Methods and properties for adjusting camera image processing parameters.
    \endtable

    Basic camera state management, error reporting, and simple zoom properties are
    available in the Camera itself.  For integration with C++ code, the
    \l mediaObject property allows you to
    access the standard Qt Multimedia camera controls.

    Many of the camera settings may take some time to apply, and might be limited
    to certain supported values depending on the hardware.  Some camera settings may be
    set manually or automatically. These settings properties contain the current set value.
    For example, when autofocus is enabled the focus zones are exposed in the
    \l {CameraFocus}{focus} property.
