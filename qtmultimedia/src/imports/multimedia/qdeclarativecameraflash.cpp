    \brief An interface for flash related camera settings.
    \ingroup multimedia_qml
    \ingroup camera_qml

    CameraFlash is part of the \b{QtMultimedia 5.0} module.

    This type allows you to operate the camera flash
    hardware and control the flash mode used.  Not all cameras have
    flash hardware (and in some cases it is shared with the
    \l {Torch}{torch} hardware).

    It should not be constructed separately, instead the
    \c flash property of a \l Camera should be used.

    \qml
    import QtQuick 2.0
    import QtMultimedia 5.0

    Camera {
        id: camera

        exposure.exposureCompensation: -1.0
        flash.mode: Camera.FlashRedEyeReduction
    }

    \endqml

    This property holds the camera flash mode.

    \row \li Camera.FlashOff             \li Flash is Off.
    \row \li Camera.FlashOn              \li Flash is On.
    \row \li Camera.FlashAuto            \li Automatic flash.
    \row \li Camera.FlashRedEyeReduction \li Red eye reduction flash.
    \row \li Camera.FlashFill            \li Use flash to fillin shadows.
    \row \li Camera.FlashTorch           \li Constant light source, useful for focusing and video capture.
    \row \li Camera.FlashSlowSyncFrontCurtain
                                \li Use the flash in conjunction with a slow shutter speed.
                                This mode allows better exposure of distant objects and/or motion blur effect.
    \row \li Camera.FlashSlowSyncRearCurtain
                                \li The similar mode to FlashSlowSyncFrontCurtain but flash is fired at the end of exposure.
    \row \li Camera.FlashManual          \li Flash power is manually set.
