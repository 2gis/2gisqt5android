    \brief The \l {Qt Multimedia} module provides audio, video, radio and camera
    functionality.

    The C++ classes provide more control over the multimedia content than the
    QML alternatives. If your application is serving complex use cases such as
    decoding media files, accessing video or audio buffers, use the C++
    alternative. For more details about the complex audio, video, and camera use
    cases supported by the C++ classes, refer to \l {Qt Multimedia Overview}.
