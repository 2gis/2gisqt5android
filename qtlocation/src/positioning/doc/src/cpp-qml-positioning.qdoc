\title Interfaces between C++ and QML Code in Qt Positioning

\brief Some of the providing QtPositioning QML types providing interfaces to access and modify properties in C++.

\section2 Address - QGeoAddress
\target geoaddress
The \l {QtPositioning::Address::address} {Address.address} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a
Address object must be obtained from C++, then use the \l {QObject::property()}{property()} and
\l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions to get and set the \c address property.
The following gets the QGeoAddress representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Address get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QGeoAddress object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Address set


\section2 Location - QGeoLocation
\target location
The \l {Location::location} {Location.location} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a
Location object must be obtained from C++, then use the \l {QObject::property()}{property()} and
\l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions to get and set the \c location property.
The following gets the QGeoLocation representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Location get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QGeoLocation object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Location set
