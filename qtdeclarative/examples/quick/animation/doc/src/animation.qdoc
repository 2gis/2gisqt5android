    \title Qt Quick Examples - Animation
    \example animation
    \brief This is a collection of QML Animation examples.
    \image qml-animations-example.png
    \ingroup qtquickexamples

    This is a collection of small QML examples relating to animation. Each example is
    a small QML file emphasizing a particular type or feature.

    ColorAnimation demonstrates using a color animation to fade a sky from day to night.
    \snippet animation/basics/color-animation.qml 0

    PropertyAnimation demonstrates using a number animation to bounce a circle up and down.
    \snippet animation/basics/property-animation.qml 0

    Animators demonstrates using a animators to bounce an icon up and down.
    \snippet animation/basics/animators.qml 0

    Behaviors demonstrates using behaviors to animate moving a rectangle to whereever you click.
    \snippet animation/behaviors/behavior-example.qml 0

    Wiggly Text demonstrates using more complex behaviors to animate and wiggle some text around as you drag it.
    It does this by assigning a complex binding to each letter:
    \snippet animation/behaviors/wigglytext.qml 0
    Then, it uses behaviors to animate the movement on each letter:
    \snippet animation/behaviors/wigglytext.qml 1

    Tv Tennis demonstrates using more complex behaviors to get paddles following a ball for an infinite game.
    Again a binding which depends on other values is applied to the position and a behavior provided the animation.
    \snippet animation/behaviors/tvtennis.qml 0

    Easing Curves shows off all the easing curves available in Qt Quick animations.

    States demonstrates how the properties of an item can vary between states.
    It defines several states:
    \snippet animation/states/states.qml 0
    Note that there is also the implicit 'base state' from properties set directly on objects.

    Transitions takes the States example and animates the property changes by setting transitions:
    \snippet animation/states/transitions.qml 0

    PathAnimation animates an image along a beizer curve using a PathAnimation.
    \snippet animation/pathanimation/pathanimation.qml 0

    PathInterpolator animates an image along the same beizer curve, using a PathInterpolator instead.
    \snippet animation/pathinterpolator/pathinterpolator.qml 0
