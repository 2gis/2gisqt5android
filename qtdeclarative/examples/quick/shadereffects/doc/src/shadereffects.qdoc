    \title Qt Quick Examples - Shader Effects
    \example shadereffects
    \image qml-shadereffects-example.png
    \brief This is a shader effects example
    \ingroup qtquickexamples

    This example demonstrates a couple of visual effects that you can perform
    with shaders in \l {Qt Quick}.

    ShaderEffects typically operate on other types, using a ShaderEffectSource
    \snippet shadereffects/shadereffects.qml source
    In the above snippet, theItem is the id of a complex QML object in the file.

    ShaderEffects can use this ShaderEffectSource as a texture in their fragment shader.
    \snippet shadereffects/shadereffects.qml fragment

    You can use any custom property on the ShaderEffect in your shader. This makes
    animated shader code very easy.
    \snippet shadereffects/shadereffects.qml properties

    ShaderEffects can also have a custom vertext shader. Setting the mesh property on ShaderEffect
    provides more vertices for you to manipulate, enabling many effects.
