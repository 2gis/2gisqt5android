    \title Qt Quick Examples - MouseArea
    \example mousearea
    \brief This is an example of the MouseArea type in QML
    \image qml-mousearea-example.png
    \ingroup qtquickexamples

    This example shows you how to respond to clicks and drags with a MouseArea.

    When you click inside the red square, the Text type will list several properties
    of that click which are available to QML.

    Signals are emitted by the MouseArea when clicks or other discrete operations occur within it
    \snippet mousearea/mousearea.qml clicks

    The MouseArea can also be used to drag items around. By setting the parameters of the drag property,
    the target item will be dragged around if the user starts to drag within the MouseArea.
