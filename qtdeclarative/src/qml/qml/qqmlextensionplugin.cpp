    \class QQmlExtensionPlugin
    \brief The QQmlExtensionPlugin class provides an abstract base for custom QML extension plugins.

    \ingroup plugins

    QQmlExtensionPlugin is a plugin interface that makes it possible to
    create QML extensions that can be loaded dynamically into QML applications.
    These extensions allow custom QML types to be made available to the QML engine.

    To write a QML extension plugin:

    \list
    \li Subclass QQmlExtensionPlugin, implement registerTypes() method to register types
    using qmlRegisterType(), and export the class using the Q_PLUGIN_METADATA() macro
    \li Write an appropriate project file for the plugin
    \li Create a \l{Module Definition qmldir Files}{qmldir file} to describe the plugin
    \endlist

    QML extension plugins can be used to provide either application-specific or
    library-like plugins. Library plugins should limit themselves to registering types,
    as any manipulation of the engine's root context may cause conflicts
    or other issues in the library user's code.


    \section1 An Example

    Suppose there is a new \c TimeModel C++ class that should be made available
    as a new QML element. It provides the current time through \c hour and \c minute
    properties, like this:

    \snippet qmlextensionplugins/plugin.cpp 0
    \dots

    To make this class available as a QML type, create a plugin that registers
    this type with a specific \l {QML Modules}{module} using qmlRegisterType(). For this example the plugin
    module will be named \c TimeExample (as defined in the project
    file further below).

    \snippet qmlextensionplugins/plugin.cpp plugin

    This registers the \c TimeModel class with the 1.0 version of this
    plugin library, as a QML type called \c Time. The Q_ASSERT statement
    ensures the module is imported correctly by any QML components that use this plugin.

    The project file defines the project as a plugin library and specifies
    it should be built into the \c imports/TimeExample directory:

    \code
    TEMPLATE = lib
    CONFIG += qt plugin
    QT += qml

    DESTDIR = imports/TimeExample
    TARGET = qmlqtimeexampleplugin
    ...
    \endcode

    Finally, a \l{Module Definition qmldir Files}{qmldir file} is required in the \c imports/TimeExample directory
    that describes the plugin. This directory includes a \c Clock.qml file that
    should be bundled with the plugin, so it needs to be specified in the \c qmldir
    file:

    \quotefile qmlextensionplugins/imports/TimeExample/qmldir

    Once the project is built and installed, the new \c Time element can be
    used by any QML component that imports the \c TimeExample module:

    \snippet qmlextensionplugins/plugins.qml 0

    The full source code is available in the \l {qmlextensionplugins}{plugins example}.

    The \l {Writing QML Extensions with C++} tutorial also contains a chapter
    on creating QML plugins.

    Note that the \l {Qt Quick 1} version is called QDeclarativeExtensionPlugin.

/*!
    \fn void QQmlExtensionPlugin::registerTypes(const char *uri)

    Registers the QML types in the given \a uri. Subclasses should implement
    this to call qmlRegisterType() for all types which are provided by the extension
    plugin.

    The \a uri is an identifier for the plugin generated by the QML engine
    based on the name and path of the extension's plugin library.
*/

/*!
    Constructs a QML extension plugin with the given \a parent.

    Note that this constructor is invoked automatically by the
    Q_PLUGIN_METADATA() macro, so there is no need for calling it
    explicitly.

    Initializes the extension from the \a uri using the \a engine. Here an application
    plugin might, for example, expose some data or objects to QML,
    as context properties on the engine's root context.
