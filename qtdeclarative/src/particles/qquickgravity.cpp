    \brief For applying accleration in an angle

    This element will accelerate all affected particles to a vector of
    the specified magnitude in the specified angle. If the angle and acceleration do
    not vary, it is more efficient to set the specified acceleration on the Emitter.

    This element models the gravity of a massive object whose center of
    gravity is far away (and thus the gravitational pull is effectively constant
    across the scene). To model the gravity of an object near or inside the scene,
    use PointAttractor.
