  \class QQuickRenderControl

  \brief The QQuickRenderControl class provides a mechanism for rendering the Qt
  Quick scenegraph onto an offscreen render target in a fully
  application-controlled manner.

  \since 5.4

  QQuickWindow and QQuickView and their associated internal render loops render
  the Qt Quick scene onto a native window. In some cases, for example when
  integrating with 3rd party OpenGL renderers, it might be beneficial to get the
  scene into a texture that can then be used in arbitrary ways by the external
  rendering engine. QQuickRenderControl makes this possible in a hardware
  accelerated manner, unlike the performance-wise limited alternative of using
  QQuickWindow::grabWindow()

  When using a QQuickRenderControl, the QQuickWindow does not have to be shown
  or even created at all. This means there will not be an underlying native
  window for it. Instead, the QQuickWindow instance is associated with the
  render control, using the overload of the QQuickWindow constructor, and an
  OpenGL framebuffer object by calling QQuickWindow::setRenderTarget().

  Management of the context and framebuffer object is up to the application. The
  context that will be used by Qt Quick must be created before calling
  initialize(). The creation of the framebuffer object can be deferred, see
  below. Qt 5.4 introduces the ability for QOpenGLContext to adopt existing
  native contexts. Together with QQuickRenderControl this makes it possible to
  create a QOpenGLContext that shares with an external rendering engine's
  existing context. This new QOpenGLContext can then be used to render the Qt
  Quick scene into a texture that is accessible by the other engine's context
  too.

  Loading and instantiation of the QML components happen by using a
  QQmlEngine. Once the root object is created, it will need to be parented to
  the QQuickWindow's contentItem().

  Applications will usually have to connect to 4 important signals:

  \list

  \li QQuickWindow::sceneGraphInitialized() Emitted at some point after calling
  QQuickRenderControl::initialize(). Upon this signal, the application is
  expected to create its framebuffer object and associate it with the
  QQuickWindow.

  \li QQuickWindow::sceneGraphInvalidated() When the scenegraph resources are
  released, the framebuffer object can be destroyed too.

  \li QQuickRenderControl::renderRequested() Indicates that the scene has to be
  rendered by calling render(). After making the context current, applications
  are expected to call render().

  \li QQuickRenderControl::sceneChanged() Inidcates that the scene has changed
  meaning that, before rendering, polishing and synchronizing is also necessary.

  \endlist

  To send events, for example mouse or keyboard events, to the scene, use
  QCoreApplication::sendEvent() with the QQuickWindow instance as the receiver.

  the fact that this requires the context, that was passed to
  initialize(), to be the current one at the time of destroying the
  QQuickRenderControl instance.

  Once invalidate() has been called, it is possible to reuse the
  QQuickRenderControl instance by calling initialize() again.
