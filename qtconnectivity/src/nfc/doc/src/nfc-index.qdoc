\title Qt NFC
\brief Enables connectivity between NFC enabled devices.
\ingroup technology-apis

The NFC API provides connectivity between NFC enabled devices.

Currently the API is supported on \l{Qt for BlackBerry}{BlackBerry 10}.

\section1 Overview

NFC is an extremely short-range (less than 20 centimeters) wireless technology and has a
maximum transfer rate of 424 kbit/s. NFC is ideal for transferring small packets of data when two
devices are touched together.

The NFC API provides APIs for interacting with NFC Forum Tags and NFC Forum Devices, including
target detection and loss, registering NDEF message handlers, reading and writing NDEF messages
on NFC Forum Tags and sending tag specific commands.


\section1 Getting started

To use the C++ library in your application, add the following configuration
option to your \c .pro file:

\snippet snippets.pro project modification

To use the classes of the module in your application you need the following
import statement in your \c .qml file:

\snippet doc_src_qtnfc.qml import
