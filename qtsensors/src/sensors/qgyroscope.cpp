    \brief The QGyroscopeReading class represents one reading from the
           gyroscope sensor.

    \section2 QGyroscopeReading Units

    The reading contains 3 values, measured in degrees per second that define
    the movement of the device around the x, y and z axes. Unlike QRotationReading,
    the values represent the current angular velocity rather than a fixed rotation.
    The measurements are in degrees per second.
