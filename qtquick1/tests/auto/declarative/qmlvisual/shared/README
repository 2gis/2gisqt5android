These components provide a standard set of what would otherwise be system dependant settings. These are
-default font
-default fontSize
-cursor blink time (unblinking cursor)

This should probably be replaced with a Test Style/Theme once QtComponents is done.
Note that having multiple font loaders is probably quite inefficient, so don't use these for performance tests.
