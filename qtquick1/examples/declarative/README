The Qt Declarative module provides the ability to specify and implement
your user interface declaratively, using the Qt Meta-Object Language (QML).
This language is very expressive and human readable, and can be used by
designers to actually implement their UI vision. QML UIs can integrate
with C++ code in many ways, including being loaded as a part of a C++ UI
and loading data models from C++ and interacting with them.

Documentation for examples can be found via the Examples and Tutorials link
in the main Qt documentation. The examples and their documentation can also
be opened from the Examples tab of Qt Creator's Welcome mode.
